## Requirements

- Node > v18
- Pnpm > v9.5

## Development

### Hot Building

While developing your resources, this boilerplate offers
a `watch` script that will automatically hot rebuild on any
change.

```sh
pnpm watch
```

_This script still requires you restart the resource for the
changes to be reflected in-game_

## Production Build

Once you have completed the development phase of your resources,
you must create an optimized & minimized production build, using
the `build` script.

```sh
pnpm build
```
